description: Enable concise response mode
---

# /trim

Enable concise, token-efficient communication mode without sacrificing clarity.

## Workflow

### 1. Response Style
- Direct answers first, elaborate only if asked
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
- Code > prose when showing solutions
- Skip obvious details and filler words

### 2. Communication Guidelines
- No verbose introductions or conclusions
- No meta-commentary about the task
- No acknowledgment unless specifically requested
- Focus on actionable information only

### 3. Code Output
- Show implementation directly
- Minimal comments (only for complex logic)
- Skip boilerplate unless relevant
- Include only essential context

### 4. Format Preferences
- Prefer lists and structured data
- Use tables for comparisons
- Keep explanations brief (1-2 sentences max)
- Break complex topics into clear sections

## Requirements

- Maintain technical accuracy and correctness
- Preserve essential context and safety considerations
- Keep code quality standards from CLAUDE.md
- Use skills when needed (software-engineering, typescript, react)
- Include error handling and type safety in code examples

## Expected Outcome

Efficient, focused responses that save tokens while maintaining:
- Correctness and completeness
- Code quality and best practices
- Clear communication of key points
- Actionable solutions
