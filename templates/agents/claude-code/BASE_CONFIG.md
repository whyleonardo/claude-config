## Git Workflow
- Do not include "Claude Code" in commit messages
- Use conventional commits (be brief and descriptive)

## Important Concepts
Focus on these principles in all code:
- e2e type-safety
- error monitoring/observability
- automated tests
- readability/maintainability

All detailed coding guidelines are in the skills:
- `software-engineering` - Core engineering principles
- `typescript` - TypeScript/JavaScript best practices
- `react` - React and Next.js patterns
- `writing` - Technical writing guidelines
- `reviewing-code` - Code review checklist
