$ARGUMENTS

## Investigation Protocol

1. **Understand the Context**
   - What is the current behavior?
   - What is the expected behavior?
   - What are the constraints and requirements?

2. **Deep Dive Analysis**
   - Trace the code flow from entry to exit
   - Identify all dependencies and side effects
   - Check for related code patterns in the codebase
   - Review git history for context if relevant

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Identify the root cause, not just symptoms
   - Consider multiple hypotheses
   - Validate assumptions with evidence

4. **Provide Recommendations**
   - Propose concrete solutions with code examples
   - Explain trade-offs of each approach
   - Suggest preventive measures for the future

Be thorough and explain your reasoning at each step.
